**Exploring Advertising Expenditure and Sales: A Linear Regression Analysis**

**Introduction:**
This report analyzes the correlation between advertising spending and sales, employing a linear regression model for prediction and evaluation.Insights from this analysis 
can guide marketing strategies for optimizing advertising budgets.

** Data Loading and Exploration:**
- Imported necessary libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Loaded the dataset "Advertising.csv" into a DataFrame `df`.
- Displayed the first few rows of the DataFrame using `df.head()`.
- Obtained statistical information about the DataFrame using `df.describe()` and `df.info()`.
- Checked for missing values using `df.isnull().sum()`.
- Examined the shape of the DataFrame using `df.shape`.

** Data Visualization:**
- Created a 3D scatter plot to visualize the relationship between TV advertising, Radio advertising, and Sales.
- Generated a 2D scatter plot to visualize the relationship between TV advertising and Sales using Seaborn.

** Data Preparation:**
- Extracted feature variables (`x`) and target variable (`y`) from the DataFrame.
- Split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()` from Scikit-learn.

** Model Building:**
- Utilized Linear Regression from Scikit-learn to build the regression model.
- Trained the model using the training data (`x_train` and `y_train`).

** Model Evaluation:**
- Evaluated the model's performance using the test data (`x_test` and `y_test`) with the `score()` method.
- Obtained the coefficients and intercept of the regression model using `reg.coef_` and `reg.intercept_`.
- Predicted the target variable (`Sales`) using the test features (`x_test`) and stored the predictions in `y_pred`.
- Created a DataFrame `df1` to compare actual and predicted Sales values.

** Visualization of Model Performance:**
- Constructed a 3D scatter plot to visualize the actual and predicted Sales values for both training and testing data.

**Conclusion:**
- The Linear Regression model achieved a certain score on the test data, indicating its predictive capability.
- Visualization aids in understanding the relationship between advertising expenditures (TV and Radio) and Sales.
- Further analysis and fine-tuning of the model might be required for better predictive accuracy.
