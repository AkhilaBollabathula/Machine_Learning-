** Data Preprocessing and Exploration Report **

Introduction:
This report presents a detailed analysis of data preprocessing techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted on two datasets.
The primary objectives include data imputation, encoding, scaling, normalization, and EDA to gain insights into the relationships between variables.

###Data Preprocessing:

***Data Imputation:
Missing values in the first dataset (`table`) were imputed using the mean strategy, ensuring completeness for subsequent analysis.
  
***One-Hot Encoding:
Categorical variables in the second dataset (`df1`) were encoded using one-hot encoding, expanding them into binary columns to facilitate machine learning model training.

### Scaling and Normalization

*** Min-Max Scaling:
Numerical data was scaled using the Min-Max scaler to a specified range, enabling consistent interpretation across variables.

***Robust Scaling:
The Robust scaler was applied to ensure robustness against outliers in the data, preventing extreme values from unduly influencing the scaling process.

*** Normalization:
Normalization was performed on numerical data using L2 normalization, ensuring that each sample had a unit norm, suitable for algorithms sensitive to data magnitude.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

*** Dataset Overview:
- The cereal dataset (`cereal.csv`) was imported and assessed for basic information, including column names and data types.
- Descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, and quartiles, were computed to understand the central tendency and spread of the data.

*** Missing Values Assessment:
A thorough check for missing values in the dataset was conducted to ensure data completeness before analysis.

*** Data Visualization:
Scatter plots were generated to explore the relationships between variables, with a particular focus on the correlation between calories and ratings.

### Machine Learning Model Preparation

*** Feature Selection:
- The independent variables (`calories` and `protein`) were selected as features (`x`) for machine learning model training.
- The dependent variable (`rating`) was designated as the target (`y`) for predictive modeling.
  
***Train-Test Split:
The data was split into training and testing sets using a 80-20 ratio to facilitate model training and evaluation.

***Conclusion:
In conclusion, the data preprocessing and exploration techniques employed in this analysis have laid a solid foundation for subsequent machine learning model development.
By addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling, and normalizing numerical data, the datasets are now ready for further analysis and model training. 
The insights gained from exploratory data analysis provide valuable understanding of the data characteristics, guiding future modeling efforts effectively.
